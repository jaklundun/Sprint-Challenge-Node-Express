# Review Questions

## What is Node.js?
    * Node js allows us to use javascript for server applications, and hosts a large source of packages to incorporate into our projects.

## What is Express?
    * Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

## Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
    *  We learned how to build an express server. We learned who to leverage custom middleware with an Express initiated server.

## What is Middleware?
    * Middleware can be thought as the bridge between the api and the client. Middleware allows us to format or filter incoming server requests so that we can easily work with the result.

## What is a Resource?
    * Everything available to provide to the client on the api is a resource. Resources are the basic parts of the API that we want to access and manipulate.

## What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
    * An API can return http status codes. A code in the 200s means success!

## How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
    * By using routers - i.e, React or Redux. 

## What is express.json() and why do we need it?
    * Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. Cors lets us to access data from an outside server from our own server.
